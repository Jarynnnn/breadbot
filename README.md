- This is an open source multi-bot used in the **[Bread Solutions](https://discord.gg/DUVx2wHTV8)**

### How do I get support?
1. You can join our [discord](https://discord.gg/DUVx2wHTV8) and open a support ticket or ask in the public channels! Unfortunately this is not guaranteed as the team members are very busy people 
2. Open a [Github issue report](https://github.com/Bread-Soultions/breadbot/issues/new). Though this is not the best way to get in touch with us.
